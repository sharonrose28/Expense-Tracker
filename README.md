These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **MongoDB** (can use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for a cloud solution or run it locally)
